Description: # Box Challenge - 
        ## filmfreeway.com @ [Joshua Moore](mailto:joshua.moore@leudla.net)
        
        This challenge consists of drawing boxes either stacked horizontally or vertically, nested inside of each other. See [box.txt].
        
        Here are the formulas to the supplied examples
        
        * `[- [| [-2] 2] 2 [|2]]`
        
        * `[| [- [|2] 2] 2 [-2]]`
        
        * `[^5]`
        
        * `[- [|3] [|3] [|3] ]`
        
        
        To run the examples, run ./bin/box.js examples/*
        Or choose a specific example.
        Or pass in a string via the command line, just be sure to escape your characters using single quotes. 
        
        
          Usage: `./bin/box.js '[ [] ]'`
          Don't forget to escape your characters as appropriate for your shell if
          using this from the command line. 
        
          Welcome to Joshua Moore's implementation of the box challenge. This program
          draws nested ASCII boxes. Here's a quick rundown of the language used for 
          controlling box.js...
        
          For a single box, enter: 
          * `[]` to get
        
        ```
            +-+
            | |
            +-+
        ```
        
          You can nest boxes by including one in another.
          * `[ [] ]`
        
        ```
            +-----+
            | +-+ |
            | | | |
            | +-+ |
            +-----+
        ```
        
          The syntax for controlling stacking behavior is pretty literal:
          * `[- [] [] ]`, including a minus - after the opening box tag stacks boxes
            horizontally.
          
          ```
            +---------+
            | +-+ +-+ |
            | | | | | |
            | +-+ +-+ |
            +---------+
        ```
        
          * `[| [] [] ]`, while a pipe will stack a box's children vertically
        
        ```
            +-----+
            | +-+ |
            | | | |
            | +-+ |
            | +-+ |
            | | | |
            | +-+ |
            +-----+
        ```
        
        
          * Of course, writing out all the boxes by hand can get cumbersome, so here's
            some shortcuts: 
        
            `[-2]` will produce two horizontally stacked children
            `[|5]` will produce five vertically stacked children
        
            Please note that numbers can only be used inside of other boxes.
        
        
          * You can mix and match number and literal syntax:
        
           `[-2[|5][-3]]` will produce 
        
        ```

            | | | | | | +-+ | | +-+ +-+ +-+ | |
            | +-+ +-+ | | | | | | | | | | | | |
            |         | +-+ | | +-+ +-+ +-+ | |
            |         | +-+ | +-------------+ |
            |         | | | |                 |
            |         | +-+ |                 |
            |         | +-+ |                 |
            |         | | | |                 |
            |         | +-+ |                 |
            |         | +-+ |                 |
            |         | | | |                 |
            |         | +-+ |                 |
            |         | +-+ |                 |
            |         | | | |                 |
            |         | +-+ |                 |
            |         +-----+                 |
            +---------------------------------+
        ```
        
          * And finally, there's a shortcut for nesting boxes
        
            `./bin/box.js '[-2[^5]3]'`
        
        ```
            +-----------------------------------------+
            | +-+ +-+ +-----------------+ +-+ +-+ +-+ |
            | | | | | | +-------------+ | | | | | | | |
            | +-+ +-+ | | +---------+ | | +-+ +-+ +-+ |
            |         | | | +-----+ | | |             |
            |         | | | | +-+ | | | |             |
            |         | | | | | | | | | |             |
            |         | | | | +-+ | | | |             |
